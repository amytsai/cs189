Question 1
----------
### (A)
Errors =  
[4.5427,
3.4368,
0.9714,
0.9537,
0.9393,
0.9348,
0.9347,
0.9331,
0.9301,
0.9092]

d = 10 has the smallest error rate. However, in practice using d = 10 will probably over fit. d = 3 is most likely the best choice.

### (B)
Test error (d=3) = 5.1577

Test error (d=10) = 5.7307

A degree 10 polynomial is overfitted to the training data and a degree 3 polynomial generalizes better to the test data.
